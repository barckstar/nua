It all started in 2018, when we noticed the rapid degradation of local biological corridors and the devastating impact this had on wildlife.\n\nWhat began as small weekend cleanup and reforestation days soon transformed into a community movement. We realized that to achieve real and lasting change, we needed a more formal structure that would allow us to manage resources, establish strategic alliances, and expand our educational reach.\n\nAfter years of hard work, planning, and the immeasurable support of the San Ramón community, Fundación Núa was legally constituted. Today, we are an organization dedicated to active conservation, scientific research, and environmental education, working tirelessly to ensure that future generations inherit a green and vibrant Costa Rica. Our journey is just beginning, and every tree planted is a testament to our commitment to life."
